Question 2
A
corporation is attempting to expand its employee mental health and wellness
initiative via an awareness campaign and is anticipating that up to four times as many employees will
participate next year compared to the previous year. The Human Resources
director will eventually need to be able to check whether a given employee has
signed up, which means searching through the list of everyone who is
participating in the campaign. Assuming the list is sorted and the HR director is using binary search, what will be the
effect on the number of operations in the worst
case if the list is four times longer than before?    

1 point
